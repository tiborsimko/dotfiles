! Tibor's Xmodmap configuration for laptops.
!
! This configuration is suitble for Thinkpad laptops.  It basically puts ESC onto CapsLock, switches Alt and Ctrl, and maps PrtSCr into something useful.
!
! For Kinesis Advantage keyboard, I remap the Dvorak layout via its hardware facility.
! ESC on CapsLock, Mod4 on Home, ESC on End.
!
! In this way both main keyboard (Kinesis) and laptop (Thinkpad) have somewhat similar layouts.

! clear the keys we are going to remap
clear control
clear lock
clear mod1
clear mod4

! set CapsLock as Escape
keycode 66 = Escape

! swap Control_L and Alt_L
keycode 64 = Control_L
keycode 37 = Alt_L Meta_L

! swap Control_R and Alt_R
keycode 108 = Control_R
keycode 105 = Alt_R Meta_R

! set PrtScr as Control_R
keycode 107 = Control_R

! add ack modifiers and control
add mod1 = Alt_L Alt_R Meta_L Meta_R
add mod4 = Super_L Super_R
add control = Control_L Control_R
