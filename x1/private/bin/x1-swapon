# Tibor's swap-to-file utility.
#
# First create files as follows:
#
# $ fallocate -l 4G /swapfile0
# $ chmod 600 /swapfile0
# $ mkswap /swapfile
#
# Then this utility can be called many times to start swapping on them.

for swapfile in /swapfile0 /swapfile1 /swapfile2; do
  if swapon | grep -q ${swapfile}; then
     true
